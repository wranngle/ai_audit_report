== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They handle customer support tickets for their project management software. About 1,200 tickets per month.
The process starts when a customer submits a support request via email or web form.

The goal is to route tickets to the right specialist and provide first response within 2 hours.
The support manager owns triage, specialists own resolution.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Ticket arrives via email or Zendesk web form
2. Support manager manually reads each ticket to determine category
3. Manager manually assigns to one of 6 specialists based on expertise and workload
4. Specialist receives notification and starts working ticket
5. Specialist searches internal wiki for similar issues (often can't find relevant info)
6. Specialist asks engineering team for help via Slack if needed
7. Engineer responds when available (no SLA for internal support)
8. Specialist updates customer via Zendesk
9. Manager manually checks all tickets daily for SLA compliance

They have 1 support manager and 6 specialists covering 24/5 (M-F around the clock).

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- Zendesk - ticketing system
- Email (Gmail) - some tickets come via email
- Slack - internal communication with engineering
- Confluence wiki - knowledge base (outdated)
- Google Sheets - SLA tracking
- Jira - bug tracking (separate from Zendesk)

== TIMING ==

Average time from ticket arrival to first response: 4.5 hours
Worst case delays: up to 24 hours when tickets are miscategorized
They work 24/5, Monday-Friday around the clock with offshore team

== PROBLEMS ==

Manual routing is slow - manager is a bottleneck, especially during peak hours (9am-11am PST).
Miscategorization happens about 20% of the time - ticket goes to wrong specialist, gets re-routed.
No integration between Zendesk and Jira - specialists manually create bug tickets.
Knowledge base is disorganized and outdated - specialists can't find solutions quickly.
Engineering team has no visibility into support queue - they don't know what's urgent.

About 35% of tickets miss the 2-hour first response SLA.

== COSTS ==

Each SLA miss costs approximately $75 in customer credits per their service agreement.
Misrouted tickets waste 30 minutes of specialist time on average.
Duplicate work - specialists solve same problems repeatedly because solutions aren't documented.
Customer churn - they've identified slow support as reason #2 for cancellations (12% annual churn rate).
Average customer lifetime value: $18,000, losing 15 customers/year to support issues.

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Their #1 priority: "Auto-route tickets based on keywords and past ticket history so our support manager doesn't have to manually triage everything"

They mentioned they need better knowledge base search with AI to help specialists find solutions faster.
