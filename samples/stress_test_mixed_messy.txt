CALL NOTES - TechStart Recruiting
Date: Dec 2024
Contact: Amanda (HR Director)

=== CURRENT STATE ===

They do technical recruiting for startups. About 50 placements/month. Big problem is their candidate pipeline tracking.

SYSTEMS:
* LinkedIn Recruiter
* Greenhouse (ATS)
* Google Sheets (???)
* Slack
* Zoom
* Gmail

So here's the thing... Amanda says the recruiters spend like 2hrs/day just updating spreadsheets. That's 5 recruiters x 2hrs x 22 days = 220 hours/month of DATA ENTRY. At $35/hr that's almost $8k/month in wasted labor!!!

--- metrics she mentioned ---
time-to-fill: 45 days (target: 30)
candidate drop-off: 35% (yikes)
double-entry errors: "happens constantly" - maybe 10-12%?
interview no-shows: 18%

One recruiter (Jason) built a bunch of Zapier automations but they break all the time and nobody else understands them

$$$$ COSTS:
- each unfilled position costs client ~$5000/month in lost productivity
- they comp clients $2000 for placements that fall through (happens ~8% of time)
- about 6-8 placements fail per month... so $12-16k

PAIN POINTS (verbatim):
"I just want Greenhouse to actually sync with LinkedIn"
"We lose candidates because we're too slow to respond"
"The spreadsheet is a nightmare, there are like 15 tabs"

priority fix >>> better automation, less manual tracking
