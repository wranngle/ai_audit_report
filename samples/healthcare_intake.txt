== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They handle new patient intake and appointment scheduling. About 450 new patients per month across 3 locations.
The process starts when a patient calls to schedule their first appointment.

The goal is to complete intake paperwork and schedule the first visit within 48 hours for routine care.
The front desk coordinator owns this process.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Patient calls, receptionist takes basic info over phone
2. Receptionist manually emails a PDF intake form to the patient
3. Patient prints, fills out by hand, and either faxes or brings to appointment
4. Front desk manually enters data from paper form into EHR system (Athenahealth)
5. Insurance verification done manually by calling insurance companies
6. Appointment scheduled once insurance verified
7. Confirmation call made 24 hours before appointment

They have 2 front desk staff handling intake during business hours (8am-5pm).

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- Phone system (RingCentral) - initial contact
- Email (Outlook) - sending intake forms
- Fax machine - receiving completed forms
- EHR system (Athenahealth) - patient records
- Insurance verification (manual phone calls)
- Google Calendar - appointment scheduling
- Excel spreadsheet - tracking intake status

== TIMING ==

Average time from initial call to scheduled appointment: 72 hours
Worst case delays: up to 2 weeks when insurance verification is complex
They work Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm

== PROBLEMS ==

Patients don't return intake forms - about 30% no-show on first appointment due to incomplete paperwork.
Insurance verification takes 45 minutes per patient on average, tying up staff.
Data entry errors when transcribing from paper to EHR - about 15% error rate on allergies and medications.
Faxed forms are often illegible, requiring callbacks to patients.
No tracking system - staff loses track of who's in what stage of intake.

About 30% of new patients fail to complete intake within the 48-hour SLA.

== COSTS ==

Each no-show costs approximately $200 in lost revenue.
Staff spends 2 hours per patient on manual data entry and verification.
Insurance verification delays cause appointment backlog, losing urgent care patients to competitors.
Data entry errors lead to clinical risks and compliance issues.

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Their #1 priority: "Automate the intake form delivery and make it digital so patients can fill it out online before their appointment"

They also want automated insurance verification to free up staff time.
