Data entry errors occur when transcribing from paper to EHR. Faxed forms are often illegible, requiring callbacks to patients. No tracking system leads to staff losing track of intake status. About 30% of new patients fail to complete intake within the 48-hour SLA.",

Worst case delays up to 2 weeks when insurance verification is complex."
