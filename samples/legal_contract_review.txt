Client: Morrison & Associates Law Firm
Date: December 14, 2024
Interviewer: Wranngle Auditor

== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They handle vendor contract reviews for corporate clients. About 85 contracts per month.
The process starts when a client emails a contract for review.

The goal is to complete initial review and return redlines within 3 business days for standard contracts.
The associate attorney owns the intake, senior partner does final review.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Client emails contract (usually PDF or Word doc) to generic firm email
2. Paralegal manually forwards to assigned attorney based on practice area
3. Attorney downloads contract and saves to shared network drive
4. Attorney manually reads entire contract (30-120 pages typical)
5. Attorney creates redline document in Word with tracked changes
6. Attorney fills out internal risk assessment form in Excel
7. Senior partner reviews redlines (another full read-through)
8. Paralegal compiles final documents and emails back to client
9. Time entry done manually in separate billing system

They have 3 associates and 2 senior partners doing contract work.

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- Email (Outlook) - client communication
- Network drive - document storage
- Microsoft Word - redlining
- Excel - risk assessment tracking
- Billing system (Clio) - time tracking
- Client database (Salesforce) - matter tracking

== TIMING ==

Average time from contract received to client delivery: 6 business days
Worst case delays: up to 3 weeks during busy periods
They work Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm (attorneys often work evenings)

== PROBLEMS ==

Standard clauses aren't standardized - each attorney has their own templates and preferences.
No way to search past contracts for similar language - attorneys re-invent the wheel.
Risk assessment is inconsistent - associates miss high-risk clauses that partners catch.
Version control issues - multiple people edit same contract, lose track of latest version.
Billing is inconsistent - attorneys forget to log time or estimate hours inaccurately.

About 40% of standard contracts miss the 3-day SLA.

== COSTS ==

Each day of delay costs approximately $300 in partner time reviewing rushed contracts.
Inconsistent risk assessment has led to 2 major client issues in the past year (liability exposure).
Associates spend 70% of their time on contract review that could be templatized.
Billing leakage - about $12,000/month in unbilled hours due to poor time tracking.
Client complaints about slow turnaround causing 3 clients to switch firms this year (average client value: $48,000/year).

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Their #1 priority: "Build a contract clause library with AI search so we can quickly find and reuse standard language from past contracts"

They also want automated risk flagging to catch problematic clauses before senior partner review.
