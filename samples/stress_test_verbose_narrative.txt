Premier Property Management Group operates a portfolio of 450 residential rental units across the metropolitan area. Our tenant screening and lease processing workflow has become increasingly problematic as we've scaled, and I wanted to document the current state before our process improvement initiative.

When a prospective tenant expresses interest in one of our properties, typically through our website contact form or Zillow listing, one of our three leasing agents receives an email notification. The agent then manually enters the prospect's information into our property management software, AppFolio, which we've been using for about four years now. This initial data entry step takes approximately 20 minutes per prospect, and we process around 180 applications per month during peak season (roughly 120 during slower months).

The screening process itself is where things get complicated. We use a third-party service called TransUnion SmartMove for background and credit checks, but this requires the agent to manually copy the applicant's information from AppFolio into the SmartMove portal - there's no API integration. The screening results come back via email as a PDF, which then needs to be downloaded and uploaded back into AppFolio. This back-and-forth takes about 35 minutes per applicant and is highly error-prone; we estimate about 15% of applications have some form of data entry error that needs correction later.

Once approved, generating the lease agreement involves pulling a template from our document management system (we use Google Drive in a fairly disorganized fashion), manually filling in the property details, tenant information, and lease terms, then sending through DocuSign for signatures. Our target turnaround from application to signed lease is 72 hours, but our actual average is closer to 6 days. During peak season, this stretches to nearly 2 weeks, which has directly resulted in losing qualified tenants to competitors - we estimate we lose about 8-10 tenants per month to slow processing.

Each lost tenant represents approximately $1,800 in vacancy costs (average rent is $1,800/month, and a lost prospect typically means at least one month of additional vacancy while we restart the search). Combined with the labor inefficiency - our leasing agents spend about 60% of their time on data entry rather than actually showing properties and closing leases - we believe the total monthly cost of this broken process is somewhere in the $25,000-30,000 range.

The systems we currently use, in addition to those mentioned: Gmail for all communication, Excel for tracking application status (AppFolio's built-in tracking isn't flexible enough for our needs), and Calendly for scheduling property showings. Our dream state would be an automated pipeline where application data flows seamlessly between systems without manual re-entry.
