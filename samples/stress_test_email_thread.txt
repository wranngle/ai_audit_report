Team,

I'm at my wit's end here. We had ANOTHER stockout on SKU-4521 yesterday. That's the third time this month.

Mike - can you pull the numbers on how often this is happening? I need to bring this to leadership.

Jen,

Ran the numbers. Here's what I found:
- We manage about 2,500 SKUs
- Stockout rate is around 12% (industry standard is 3%)
- Each stockout costs us roughly $800 in lost sales + expedited shipping
- We're doing inventory counts manually in Excel - takes warehouse team about 20hrs/week
- The data from our POS (Square) doesn't sync to our inventory spreadsheet automatically

The root cause is we're reactive not proactive. By the time we notice something's low, it's too late.

Adding to Mike's email - I spend at least 2 hours a day reconciling orders between Square, our shipping software (ShipStation), and the Excel inventory tracker. It's mind-numbing and I still make mistakes. Probably 5% error rate on my data entry honestly.

We really need a proper inventory management system that talks to everything.

Thanks both. We're losing probably $30-40K/month on this if I add up the stockouts + labor + errors.

Acme Supply Co has been doing this the same way for 10 years. Time for a change.
