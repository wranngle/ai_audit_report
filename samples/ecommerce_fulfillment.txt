Client: HomeGoods Express
Date: December 14, 2024
Interviewer: Wranngle Auditor

== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They handle order fulfillment for home goods sold through Shopify. About 2,800 orders per month.
The process starts when a customer completes checkout on their website.

The goal is to ship orders within 24 hours for in-stock items.
The warehouse manager owns this process end-to-end.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Order comes in through Shopify
2. Email notification sent to warehouse team
3. Warehouse staff manually prints packing slip from email
4. Staff checks inventory in separate spreadsheet to see if item is in stock
5. If in stock, item is picked from warehouse shelves
6. Manual packing and labeling using USPS Click-N-Ship website
7. Shipping label printed and applied
8. Warehouse staff manually updates order status in Shopify
9. Tracking number copied and pasted into customer notification email

They have 4 warehouse staff working shifts to cover 6am-8pm daily.

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- Shopify store - order intake
- Email inbox (Gmail) - order notifications
- Excel spreadsheet - inventory tracking
- USPS Click-N-Ship - shipping labels
- Paper packing slips - pick lists
- Manual inventory counts - weekly cycle counts

== TIMING ==

Average time from order to shipment: 38 hours
Worst case delays: up to 5 days during peak seasons
They work 7 days per week, 6am-8pm

== PROBLEMS ==

Inventory spreadsheet is frequently out of sync with actual stock - leads to overselling.
Staff can't find items in warehouse because location tracking is on paper.
Peak season (holidays) creates massive backlog - orders take 5+ days.
Tracking numbers are manually entered wrong about 10% of the time.
Customer service gets 50+ "where's my order" calls per day.

About 25% of orders miss the 24-hour shipping SLA.

== COSTS ==

Each delayed order costs approximately $15 in customer service time and rush shipping to make up for delays.
Overselling causes refunds and customer complaints - about 8% of orders are oversold.
Lost sales due to "out of stock" when items are actually available but not found.
Customer acquisition cost is $45, and delayed shipping causes 12% of first-time buyers not to return.

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Their #1 priority: "Sync Shopify with our inventory in real-time so we stop overselling and can auto-generate shipping labels"

They mentioned they desperately need better inventory location tracking to speed up picking.
