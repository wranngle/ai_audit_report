== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They run client onboarding - taking new signed clients from contract to first campaign launch.
About 25 new clients per month.

The process starts when a signed contract hits their CRM (HubSpot).
Goal is to launch their first campaign within 14 business days of contract signing.
The Client Success Manager owns this process.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Sales closes deal in HubSpot, marks as "Won"
2. CSM gets email notification (often delayed 2-4 hours)
3. CSM manually creates project in Monday.com
4. CSM sends welcome email from Gmail template
5. CSM schedules kickoff call via Calendly
6. After kickoff, CSM creates campaign brief in Google Docs
7. CSM assigns tasks to creative team in Monday.com
8. Creative delivers assets, CSM uploads to client's ad platforms
9. Campaign goes live, CSM marks as "Launched" in HubSpot

Average time from contract to launch: 18 business days.
Target SLA is 14 days but they're consistently missing it.
Worst case: 32 business days (lost a major client due to this)

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- CRM (HubSpot) - deal tracking and client records
- Project management (Monday.com) - task tracking
- Email (Gmail) - client communication
- Scheduling (Calendly) - kickoff calls
- Docs (Google Docs) - campaign briefs
- Various ad platforms - Meta, Google Ads, LinkedIn

== PROBLEMS ==

1. CRM → Monday sync is manual. CSM forgets or delays project creation.
2. Welcome emails are inconsistent - each CSM has their own template version.
3. Kickoff calls get scheduled 5-7 days out due to calendar conflicts.
4. Campaign briefs sit waiting for client feedback for 3-5 days average.
5. No visibility into which onboardings are at risk of missing SLA.

Miss rate for 14-day SLA: 68%
Average delay past SLA: 4 days

== COSTS ==

- Each delayed onboarding risks client churn - estimated 8% churn rate for delayed clients
- Average client lifetime value: $36,000
- Staff time wasted on manual syncing: ~3 hours per onboarding
- CSM hourly cost: $45

Client just lost their biggest account ($120k/year) due to 32-day onboarding delay.
They also get bad reviews that hurt new business acquisition.

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Top priority: "Auto-create Monday.com project when deal closes, with all tasks pre-populated"
Secondary: "Dashboard showing onboardings at risk of missing SLA"
