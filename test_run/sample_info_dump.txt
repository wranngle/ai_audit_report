== WORKFLOW OVERVIEW ==

They handle maintenance requests from tenants. About 180 requests per month.
The process starts when a tenant submits a maintenance request via their AppFolio portal.

The goal is to get a technician scheduled and the tenant confirmed within 24 hours for routine maintenance.
The operations coordinator owns this process end-to-end.

== CURRENT PROCESS ==

1. Request comes in via email notification from AppFolio
2. Coordinator manually copies request details into their Excel work order spreadsheet
3. Coordinator checks Google Calendar for technician availability (often looking at stale data)
4. Coordinator calls tenant to confirm the appointment time
5. Once confirmed, the appointment is considered complete

They have 3 coordinators handling requests. Peak volume is Monday mornings.

== SYSTEMS USED ==

- Tenant portal (AppFolio) - where requests originate
- Email inbox (Outlook) - notifications come here
- Technician calendar (Google Calendar) - availability tracking
- Work order spreadsheet (Excel) - tracking all requests
- Phone calls to tenants - confirmation step

== TIMING ==

Average time from request to confirmed appointment: 26 hours
Worst case delays: up to 4 days
They work 8am to 6pm weekdays

== PROBLEMS ==

Double-bookings happen when calendar isn't refreshed before scheduling.
Requests get buried in the email inbox, leading to missed appointments.
Tenant no-shows because the confirmation call was delayed.
Emergency requests sometimes get treated as routine due to misread priority.

About 15% of requests miss their 24-hour SLA for routine maintenance.

== COSTS ==

Each missed SLA costs approximately $150 in tenant credits.
They also spend staff time on escalation handling.
Emergency delays can cause property damage - had a burst pipe sit for 2 days once.
Tenant complaints lead to negative reviews which hurt lease renewals.

== WHAT THEY WANT FIXED ==

Their #1 priority: "Eliminate the manual copy-paste from portal to spreadsheet and auto-check technician availability"

They mentioned they'd love to stop the double-bookings entirely.
